This software uses the following libraries, which you will need installed
on your computer to work.

allegro5.1
libsndfile
fftw3

It's reccommended that you install these to your system using your
distributions package manager, or on OSX Homebrew.

If this isn't an option, the various vendors websites are listed below:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/files/allegro-unstable/5.1.8
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download
http://www.fftw.org/download.html




In order to compile the software, run the make command from the terminal.







Using SILO

SILO's input structure is:

./silo.out -i input.wav -s 1.4


At the moment, only wav files are officially supported but feel free to test 
other file types and let me know the results.  MP3 will not work, and will cause
the world to stop spinning should you attempt to use one.  You have been warned.


The -s value is a 'smoothness' value, feel free to alter it however you like.
Again if it does break, please let me know :)

SILO outputs .obj files to the output directory, which can be perused at your
leisure using a 3D Software package such as Blender.  If you achieve any 
interesting results, please consider screen shotting them to me.









EVALUATION
